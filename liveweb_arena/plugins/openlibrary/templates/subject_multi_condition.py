"""Subject multi-condition filter template for Open Library - HARD DIFFICULTY

RL-friendly design:
- Requires scanning search results for a subject and checking multiple books
- Requires evaluating TWO conditions simultaneously (cannot sort single column)
- Large exploration space: subject × condition × thresholds
- Dynamic data: edition counts and publish years shift as new editions appear
- Combinatorial question space prevents memorization
- All data visible on search results page: edition counts, publish years, fulltext
